## Description

### Outline

### The tasks library

### Classes included

### Applications included

## Installation

The apps folder contains three executables compiled in MATLAB. MATLAB Runtime is required to run these desktop applications and will be downloaded from the web during the first installation.

### First time set-up

The apps require a tasks library to run. MATLAB Compiler doesn't allow specification of installation directories for required files. The apps were designed to allow multiple users to access the same tasks library across a shared network so the apps search for a text file to tell it where to find the tasks library.
